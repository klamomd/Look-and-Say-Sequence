# Look-and-Say-Sequence
Wiki Article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence

An automated 'look-and-say sequence' calculator. Just pieced this together for curiosity's sake. Wanted to see if these sequences truly never contain a digit higher than 3 (apart from possibly the seed value which remains at the end of each sequence), and it turns out they never do!

# Usage
Build and run the program, then just follow the prompts. Provide a seed value (1-9) and the number of sequences you want to calculate (some number greater than 0). Error-checking *SHOULD* keep the user from doing anything stupid. **NOTE: higher sequence values (40ish and greater) start taking a while to calculate!**
